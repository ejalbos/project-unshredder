Trying to solve the engineering challange posed by this website:

It reads in the file (provided) and breaks it up into slices of known size.
Along the way various info is printed.
The image output is:
* tentative matched pairs (to show what the alroithm is matching up)
* and aggregate of the matched pairs (for easier viewing)
* the unshredded image

You can shred your own images (see the rake 'shred' task) and try the unshredder on them.

## Running It

run "rake -T" to see what is available
